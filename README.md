# Skin Cancer Detection

## Brief Intro
This repo is an application using ML function to do classification on images and detect whether it'll have features of skin cancer or not. Since we'd focus mainly on ML part last time, we may contribute more to application development this time. JS web page may included.

## Project Intro
Build an application that uses deep learning to detect skin cancer and based on probablitiy will connect or recommend a doctor to see.  For example, if it is high priority, recommend nearby dermotolgist.  if not, a general practicioner.  Also, the app should include videos based on the resutls to educate the user.
For AI models, please research few models already implemented by researchers and are open sourced and use them.

## User Story & Teches may Cover
- Interface should be brief, clean and easy to use
- There may be a button for sending results directly to user or wait until results show up on webpage
- Map API may be added after diagnoized to show hospitals around.

## Challenges
ML Part:
- Body fur may cover and interfere with features on skin
- Pics with low resolution

Web Construction:

- Multiple requests from different client
- Using cloud to save data ( ?)
